# linkedInk
An online platform for users to find an artist and book their next tattoo appointment

This app was developed by me (Stephen Gallagher) as my project 3 submission during the Ironhack Web Development
Bootcamp in Berlin.

Students were given 1.5 weeks to create a web application with the following criteria:

- Use React for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
- Use Express for your API backend that your React app will communicate with.
- Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
- Have 3 models or more. 
- Have validation on its models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
- Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and 
  authorization

I thoroughly enjoyed building LinkedInk as it allowed my to utilise the skills I have developed throughout the
bootcamp along with my interest in tattoo artistry to create an app that I am really proud of.

I gave myself the challenge of creating two different types of users, of which both will use the website for a
different purpose. Users can create an account as either looking for a tattoo (User) or a tattoo artist (Artist)

UER ACCOUNT
- User creates an account and selects their favourite tattoo styles
- User can create a ‘collection’ of images that is displayed on their dashboard
- Users explore the website and add artist’s images to their personal collections
- Users can leave reviews on artist or studio profiles, add appointments to their dashboard and make a booking request

ARTIST ACCOUNT
- Artist creates account and selects their tattoo styles
- Artist uploads images of their work to their public profile
- Artist can create and become a member of a tattoo studio
- Artist receives reviews and booking requests from users
